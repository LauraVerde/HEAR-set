# HEAR-set
A ligHtwEight Acoustic paRameter set 

Version (1.0.0)

The HEAR set is a set of available acoustic parameters useful for assessing voice quality in subjects with mental disorders, highlighting early signs of these disorders and supporting their correct medical diagnosis. The acoustic parameter set consists of jitter analysis, spectral centroid, Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), and their derivatives. 

The aim is to provide researchers with a fast and reliable acoustic parameter set to support their studies on voice processing and early diagnosis of specific disorders.


## Structure of the repository

The repository contains:\
*[parameters_scripts](https://github.com/LauraVerde/HEAR-set/tree/main/parameters_scripts): scripts to extract acoustic parameters.


## Credits

This toolkit is build using Matlab R2023a, licensed to Universit√† della Campania "Luigi Vanvitelli"upon the following software libraries. The tools use the Audio Toolbox (v.3.4).
Additionnaly, the Python library "praat-parselmouth" (v.0.4.3) is used.
